* Introduction
  This page shows some examples. The org source document is [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ptpt/org-notes-style/master/examples.org][here]].

* VERSE                                                             :orgmode:
  VERSE is used to keep the line breaks in a reagin. This is a VERSE:
  #+BEGIN_VERSE
Great clouds overhead
 Tiny black birds rise and fall
  Snow covers Emacs

  -- AlexSchroeder
  #+END_VERSE
  Notice: As you can see, the starting whitespaces counts.
* This is a quote                                           :orgmode:example:
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not any simpler
  -- Albert Einstein
  #+END_QUOTE

  Just like a normal paragraph but it is quoted.

** QUOTE Quoted level
   This level is quoted

* =EXAMPLE=
  An EXAMPLE is used to include literal examples.

  This is an EXAMPLE:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Some example from a text file.
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  You can also start the example lines with a *colon* followed by *a
  space*:
  : Some example started with a colon followed by a space.

  If example is source code, you can use =BEGIN_SRC= block instead.

* Source code
  You can always use =M-x org-edit-src-code= to edit the code block in
  another buffer.

  Print =hello world= in C:
  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
         printf("hello this world\n");
         return 0;
    }
  #+END_SRC

* Markups
  - /This is italic/
  - *This is bold*
  - This is _underlined_
  - This is a =variable=, ~verbatim~
  - +this is deleted+

  This is a horizontal line
  -----

* Drawers
  :CLOCK:
  This is a drawer
  :END:

* Footnots
  The Org homepage[fn:orglink: org mode homepage] now looks a lot better than
  it used to.

  Inline definition [fn:: This is the inline definition of this footnote].

  Org homepage again [fn:orglink]. Don't tell others that the link is: http://orgmode.org

  An issue about the footnote [fn:issue: The definition is wrapped in a paragraph (=<p>=) hence a new line].

* Math formula
  The formula:

  $$ f(x) = x^2 + 2 $$

  where $x$ is some value and $f(x)$ returns the result.
